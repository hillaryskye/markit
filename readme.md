What makes you a great web developer?
  - I think I make a good Web Developer as I have a good eye for design, color and position as well as understand the Full stack as I have learned with Galvanize.  I also have knowledge of database with my recent experience with MongoDb and my previous experience with SQL.  I also must say I stand out as I think outside the box.

2.       In your own words, what makes Object Oriented Programming a good approach to solving problems?
  - It solves real world problems as OOP is setup to modularize.  An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior, and in modern programming languages it binds to the systems we use today.  State and behavior of Object Oriented Programming can be instantiated and therefore will be inherited. It is a good approach because it allows for reusability.

3.       What is semantic markup and why should we care about it.
  - There are a few reasons as to why to use semantic markup:
    * It is helpful in helping to understand the direct idea that a user is wanting to get across.  For ex, in a newspaper article, it is good to use the <article tag as it sets the meaning onto the selected text that is displayed.
    * It is also easier to have a consistent CSS system across several pages to offer a consistent brand for a client with a series of semantic tags in the HTML.
    * It is good for the Google robots to understand the purpose of the HTML in achieving good results with a good understanding of what the meaning of the code is.

4.       Please fork our codepen module and do the following, with a link to your forked codepen here:

a.       Construct an HTML representation of the “Prototype” image seen in the codepen.

b.      Populate the HTML with data from the API.

c.       Abstract the AJAX call into a function that will accept a symbol.

d.      Add an input box to manually switch the symbol.
